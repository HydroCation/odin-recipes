TheOdinProject's basic HTML website for food recipes

I've decided to up my HTML game and follow The Odin Project's code path.

This project intends to be a basic HTML page that describes 3 of my favourite recipes.
I intend to showcase a basic knowledge of HTML, including stuff like hyperlinking and image linking.
I also intend to showcase a basic understanding of Git and GitHub, including the procedure to host a webpage.
